Shown are only those files, which are non-standard ZeroPanels-files. Because of the very early release-stage I have no pre-made STL's yet. So you need some kind of CAD-Software for export.

All missing files can be downloaded from the main repository. Currently you'll find the files here: 

https://github.com/zruncho3d/ZeroPanels

If possible I'll try to do a PR on this repository when I figured out how that works...

Some pictures of the early installation while upgrading my printer from V0.1 to V0.2. Please have in mind that my printer uses multiple mods including hartk's tophad mod. It is the inofficial predecessor of the V0.2 extrusion tophat. So yours probably will look different.

As I am very poor on CAD these files are "butchered" versions of zrunchos awesome work. Please be patient with me on this point. As one major issue on this, all the parametric options got lost. If anyone can fix this, it would be appreciated a lot.

This this version alpha 0.1 and has only been tested on my modified V0.2 right now.
