### What's new

**09-JUL-2023**

Added StealthHandle and StealthMagnets (with STLs)
Merged a fix from probaly-Erwins-cat

**older**

The provided STL files are now print-in-place. Grouped STLs for the front, left and right panel are also provided. The V0 fits two groups at once. (provided by probaly-Erwins-cat. THX!)

### About ZeroPanels

ZeroPanels offer a great way to get easy removable panels on yout V0-ish printers. They remove a lot of nuts and are super-easy to install. As they were made for zrunchos great mods on the V0, I changed the to be used with a stock V0.2 as good as possible.

All missing files can be downloaded from the main repository. Currently you'll find the files here: 

https://github.com/zruncho3d/ZeroPanels

If possible I'll try to do a PR on this repository when I figured out how that works...

### About StealthHandle and StealthMagnets

I thought the standard-handle just looked wrong on the stealth-design and made a fitting handle.

If you use the ZeroPanels your standard magnet-mounts won't work anymore. As they also can't be used with no-drop-nuts I modded them to the StealthMagnet.

So it now has: Offset for the Panels, beefier stealth-look and can be used with 2 no-drop-nuts and standard voron magnets.

### Printing-tips:

**For printing-instructions on the ZeroPanels please read: https://github.com/zruncho3d/ZeroPanels#printing-tips**

For the StealthMagnets just use Voron standard settings.

For the StealthHandle you unfortunatly need supports atm. Please paint them/add them in your slicer in the marked area:

You should not need supports on the hollow inside of the handle. Don't waste your filament here!

### Pictures

Some pictures of the Panels while upgrading my printer from V0.1 to V0.2. Please have in mind that my printer uses multiple mods including hartk's tophad mod. It is the inofficial predecessor of the V0.2 extrusion tophat. So yours probably will look different.

### notes

As I am very poor on CAD these files are "butchered" versions of zrunchos awesome work. Please be patient with me on this point. As one major issue on this, all the parametric options got lost. If anyone can fix this, it would be appreciated a lot.

This this version alpha 0.1 and has only been tested on my modified V0.2 right now.

Thans to zruncho and probalby-erwins-cat for their work.
